Executive Summary\nDevelop an AI-powered clinical information retrieval agent that reduces the time nursing staff spend searching for patient information in the Epic EMR system. The agent will provide summarized patient history, flag critical information, and suggest relevant clinical protocols while maintaining strict boundaries that preserve human clinical decision-making authority.\n\n### 2. Business Objectives\n- **Primary:** Reduce nursing search time from 20% to <10% of shift time\n- **Secondary:** Improve information accessibility for clinical decision support\n- **Tertiary:** Standardize information presentation across care settings\n\n### 3. Functional Requirements\n\n#### 3.1 Information Retrieval\n- FR-01: System shall retrieve patient demographics from Epic FHIR API\n- FR-02: System shall retrieve and summarize patient encounter history\n- FR-03: System shall retrieve and present current medications with interaction flags\n- FR-04: System shall retrieve and summarize relevant diagnoses and problem list\n- FR-05: System shall retrieve recent lab results with abnormal value highlighting\n\n#### 3.2 Summarization\n- FR-10: System shall generate concise patient summaries (<500 words)\n- FR-11: System shall prioritize clinically relevant information based on context\n- FR-12: System shall flag critical values and urgent conditions\n- FR-13: System shall indicate confidence level for summarized information\n\n#### 3.3 Protocol Suggestions\n- FR-20: System shall suggest relevant clinical protocols based on patient conditions\n- FR-21: System shall present protocol suggestions as reference only (not directives)\n- FR-22: System shall link to source protocols in clinical documentation system\n\n### 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n#### 4.1 Security & Compliance\n- NFR-01: System shall comply with HIPAA Security Rule requirements\n- NFR-02: System shall implement role-based access control aligned with Epic permissions\n- NFR-03: System shall log all patient data access for audit purposes\n- NFR-04: System shall encrypt all data at rest and in transit\n\n#### 4.2 Performance\n- NFR-10: System shall return patient summaries within 5 seconds\n- NFR-11: System shall support concurrent access by 500+ users\n- NFR-12: System shall maintain 99.5% availability during clinical hours\n\n#### 4.3 Usability\n- NFR-20: System shall integrate with existing Epic workflow (in-context launch)\n- NFR-21: System shall require <30 minutes training for clinical staff\n- NFR-22: System shall provide clear visual distinction between AI-generated and source content\n\n### 5. Constraints & Boundaries\n- **BOUNDARY-01:** Agent shall NOT provide clinical recommendations or diagnoses\n- **BOUNDARY-02:** Agent shall NOT make treatment suggestions\n- **BOUNDARY-03:** Agent shall NOT override or modify clinical orders\n- **BOUNDARY-04:** All outputs require human clinician review before action\n\n### 6. Success Metrics\n- Reduction in average search time per patient (target: 50% reduction)\n- Nursing staff satisfaction score (target: >4.0/5.0)\n- Zero patient safety incidents attributable to agent-provided information\n- HIPAA compliance audit pass rate (target: 100%)",
