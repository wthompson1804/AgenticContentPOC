    "justification": "A T2 (Procedural Workflow) agent is the appropriate tier for this clinical information retrieval use case because:\n\n1. **Multi-step workflow execution**: The agent must orchestrate multiple API calls (patient demographics, encounters, medications, labs) and synthesize results — a T1 conversational agent couldn't handle this complexity.\n\n2. **Tool integration required**: Deep integration with Epic FHIR APIs and potentially CDS systems requires procedural tool use, not just conversational interfaces.\n\n3. **Human remains in loop**: The explicit boundary that the agent provides information only (no clinical decisions) aligns perfectly with T2's 'escalate to human' model. T3 autonomy would be inappropriate for this regulated domain.\n\n4. **Structured output needed**: The summarization and protocol suggestion features require deterministic formatting and reliable outputs — characteristics of T2 workflow agents.\n\nA T3 (Cognitive Autonomous) agent would introduce unnecessary risk given the healthcare context, while T1 (Conversational) would lack the integration and workflow capabilities required.",
    "architecture_summary": "**Recommended Architecture:**\n\n**Input Layer:**\n- Epic CDS Hooks trigger on patient chart open\n- User query via embedded chat interface\n\n**Processing Layer:**\n- FHIR API Gateway for Epic data access\n- Summarization engine (LLM with clinical fine-tuning)\n- Protocol matching service\n\n**Output Layer:**\n- Structured summary panel in Epic sidebar\n- Protocol reference links\n- Confidence indicators and source citations\n\n**Safety Layer:**\n- Input validation and scope enforcement\n- Output verification against clinical boundaries\n- Comprehensive audit logging\n- Human confirmation for any actionable information",

Can execute defined workflows, access external systems via APIs, and present synthesized information. Requires human oversight for decisions.\n\n### Justification\n[See justification field above]\n\n### Architecture Overview\n[See architecture_summary field above]\n\n### Risk Considerations\n- **Scope creep:** Pressure to add 'smart' recommendations must be resisted\n- **Over-reliance:** Clear UI labeling as 'AI-assisted' information\n- **Integration complexity:** Epic API approval timeline may impact schedule\n\n### Human-in-the-Loop Requirements\n- All outputs presented as reference information only\n- No auto-population of clinical fields\n- Explicit user acknowledgment for any workflow continuation"
