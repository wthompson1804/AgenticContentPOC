A T2 (Procedural Workflow) agent is recommended because the task involves multi-step information retrieval and summarization with tool integration (EMR access), but critical decisions remain with human clinicians. The 'caution' recommendation reflects the need for robust HIPAA compliance, clinical validation workflows, and careful attention to the boundary between information presentation and clinical decision-making.",

Clinical documentation and information retrieval are among the top use cases. Epic has launched AI-powered tools including ambient documentation and clinical decision support. Key success factors include clinician trust, workflow integration, and demonstrated time savings. Early adopters report 15-30% reduction in documentation time with well-implemented AI assistants.",

For information retrieval without clinical recommendations, the tool likely qualifies as a 'non-device' CDS under FDA guidance. HIPAA requires: minimum necessary access, audit trails, BAA with vendors, encryption at rest and in transit. OCR has signaled increased enforcement focus on AI systems handling PHI.",

For a clinical information agent, FHIR APIs provide patient demographics, encounters, diagnoses, medications, and clinical notes. Real-time integration requires Epic's approval process. Alternative approaches include HL7 feeds or database read replicas, though these add latency and complexity.",

Common root causes: training data bias, inadequate clinical validation, unclear human-AI boundaries, and alert fatigue from over-triggering. Successful implementations emphasize: narrow scope, continuous monitoring, and explicit 'AI-assisted' labeling.",

For a 3,000-employee organization with ~1,000 nurses, annual savings potential: ~$3-5M. Implementation costs: Epic integration ($200-500K), development ($300-600K), compliance/validation ($100-200K), ongoing maintenance (~$150K/year).
